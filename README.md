# my_toyc__compiler
A C language compiler for self-study, modeled after the c4 project, supporting only if and while statements. 
The compiler's frontend consists of common lexical analysis and syntax analysis. 
The compiler implements a simple virtual machine as its backend, where the generated assembly instructions are executed within this small virtual machine function.
